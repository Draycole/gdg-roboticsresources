Welcome to the first week of the GDG Robotics & Embedded Systems Track! 🚀  
This week, we’ll set up our tools, understand the basics of the Arduino ecosystem, and complete a simple hands-on LED challenge.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Install and set up the **Arduino IDE**
- Understand how Arduino code is structured (`setup()` and `loop()`)
- Write and upload your first sketch
- Simulate simple circuits on **Tinkercad** or **Wokwi**
- Complete the LED Circuit Challenge

## ⚙️ Step 1 – Setting Up the Arduino IDE

1. Download the **Arduino IDE** from the official site:  
   → [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

2. After installation:
   - Go to **Tools → Board → Arduino Uno**
   - Plug in your board (if you have one)  
   - Or use an online simulator (see Step 3 below)

3. (Optional) Try the IDE online via **Arduino Cloud Web Editor:**
