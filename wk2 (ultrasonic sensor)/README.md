# Week 1 — Ultrasonic Sensor

Hey everyone 👋  
Thanks a lot for showing up today; it was a really good time!

---

## 🧩 What We Covered

- Basics of the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- How it measures distance using **sound wave echo timing**
- Breadboarding and wiring on power rails
- How to connect the **Trig** and **Echo** pins to the Arduino
- Watching live **distance readings** update in real time

We also briefly discussed how servos move at precise angles (we’ll revisit this in detail next week).

---

## 💻 Sample Code

A simple Arduino sketch to get started is provided in the [`code/`](ultrasonic_basic.ino) file.

You can upload it to your Arduino and open the **Serial Monitor** to see real-time distance measurements.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting (IDE Loading Issue)

If your Arduino IDE hangs on startup:

1. Open **Task Manager** and end the Arduino process.  
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\`.  
3. Rename the folder `Arduino15` → `Arduino15_backup`.  
4. Reopen the IDE.

If it still fails, search online for other fixes or reach out for help.

## 🧠 Challenge of the Week

**Project:** *Proximity Alarm System*  
Use the ultrasonic sensor to trigger an action when an object gets too close.  
It could:
- Light up an LED  
- Beep a buzzer  
- Display a message on an LCD  

Tinkercad is recommended for simulation (it supports ultrasonic sensors well).  
Be creative with your response!
