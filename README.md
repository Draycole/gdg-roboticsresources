# GDG Robotics & Embedded Systems Track - Resource Hub

Hey guys 👋
Hope we're doing good.

This repository's going to be the reference hub for the Robotics Track.

It contains all supporting materials used throughout our study jams — setup guides, C++ refreshers, tutorials on sensors, motor drivers, and circuit integration.

The goal is to help every member learn at their own pace, build a strong foundation in embedded systems, and gain the confidence to take on full robotics projects.

Each project we'll end up building will have its own dedicated repository, while this repo remains the go-to reference library for all shared documentation, example codes, and component explanations.

You can also check out the circuit challenge repo [here](./circuit_challenges) for previous winners, former challenges and this week's task.
