# 🧩 Circuit Challenges – GDG Robotics Track

Welcome to the **Circuit Challenges** section! 🎯  
Here’s where all our weekly mini-projects, creative assignments, and winning submissions live.

These challenges are designed to help you:
- Apply what we’ve learned in study jams  
- Get hands-on practice building and simulating circuits  
- Learn from other members’ solutions  
- Have fun experimenting with new components  

Each challenge will have:
- A **description** of the task  
- A **reference schematic or example solution**  
- A folder containing **community submissions**  
- The **featured/winning project** of the week 🏆

## 🧠 Recommended Tools

If you don’t have physical components, you can still participate using simulators:

- [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) *(Great for beginners)*
- [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com) *(More advanced and versatile but long waiting time for build)*
- [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p/downloads/) *(Offline option)*

## 🏁 Submitting Your Challenge

1. Complete your project (on **hardware** or a **simulator**)  
2. Save your `.ino` file, schematic, and any screenshots  
3. Upload them as a zip in the Telegram group (or make a PR if you know Git)  
4. Include:
   - Your name
   - A short description of what your circuit does
   - Optional: a screenshot or 10s demo GIF/video

## 🏆 Recognition

- The most **creative or well-documented** submission each week gets featured here 🥇  
- We’ll post it on the community’s page and highlight your approach so others can learn from it!
