# 🚨 Challenge 2 – *Radar Response*  
### **Ultrasonic-Triggered Circuits**

### 🗓️ Week 2 Challenge  
**Theme:** Sensors, thresholds, triggers, and interactive behavior

---

## 🧩 Challenge Overview

For our second GDG Robotics mini-challenge, members leveled up from simple outputs to sensor-driven logic.

> **“Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and trigger an action.”**

This challenge opened the door for:
- Alarms  
- Displays  
- Games  
- Interactive circuits  
- Anything that *reacts* to closeness or motion  

Members were free to simulate on **Tinkercad**, **Wokwi**, or use physical hardware.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By completing this challenge, members practiced how to:

- Read sensor values using `pulseIn()` or HC-SR04 libraries  
- Convert echo time to distance  
- Implement threshold-based logic  
- Trigger outputs (LEDs, buzzers, servos, LCDs, etc.)  
- Write clear, structured `if`/`else` conditions  
- Combine inputs and outputs to form complete behaviours

This challenge built foundations for reactive robotics systems.

## 🏗️ Basic Task

Create a circuit where something happens when an object gets too close.

Threshold selection was up to you — fixed or adjustable via components.

## 🥇 Featured Project: **Nifemi’s Adaptive Proximity Alert System**

**By:** *Nifemi*  
**Platform:** Tinkercad Circuits  

**Concept:**  
A fully interactive proximity alarm that reacts when objects enter a user-defined distance range.

**Highlights:**  
- Smart use of the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**  
- **Potentiometer** for manually adjusting threshold distance  
- **LCD display** showing live distance + status  
- **Buzzer** tone and **LED** flash when in alert zone  
- Clean logic and excellent user experience

A polished and impressive submission 👏
