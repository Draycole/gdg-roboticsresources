# 💡 Challenge 1 – LED Randomizer Game

### 🗓️ Week 1 Challenge  
**Theme:** Getting started with Arduino basics (pin mapping, outputs, timing, and logic)

---

## 🧩 Challenge Overview

The first GDG Robotics circuit challenge was simple 
> **“Do something cool with one or more LEDs.”**

We were free to experiment with **blinking, fading, timing logic, or patterns**, using either **Tinkercad** or **Wokwi** or physical hardware if you had yours.

The idea was to:
- Get familiar with the Arduino IDE and basic syntax  
- Practice writing clean, logical code  
- Experiment with loops, delays, and digital pin control

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By completing this challenge, members learned how to:
- Write and upload simple Arduino sketches  
- Use `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` effectively  
- Create randomized or patterned outputs with LEDs  
- Simulate hardware connections using Tinkercad Circuits or Wokwi

---

## 🏗️ Basic Task

Create a circuit that does something *fun or dynamic* using one or more LEDs.  
You can:
- Make them blink in patterns  
- Alternate flashes between LEDs  
- Trigger lights based on input (e.g., button press)  
- Or even generate **random sequences** 🎲

## 🥇 Featured Project: Wale’s LED Randomizer Game

**By:** *Wale*  
<!--- **Platform:** Tinkercad Circuits  --->
**Concept:** A mini “reaction” game where LED lights up in a random sequence, and the user must press the correct order of the sequence that the LED's came up on .  
**Highlights:**  
- Used `random()` to vary LED lighting times  
- Introduced user interactivity with a push button  
- Great logic and clean implementation
